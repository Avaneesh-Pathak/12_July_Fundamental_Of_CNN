    "the key difference between object detection and object classification lies in their scope and output. Object classification focuses on assigning a single label to the entire image, while object detection not only classifies objects but also provides precise spatial information about their locations within the image. Object detection is a more complex task because it involves both classification and localization, making it suitable for applications where the position of objects matters."
